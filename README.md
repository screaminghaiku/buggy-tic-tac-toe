// 1. Register click
// 2. Make button render icon on click
// 3. Have click alternate between X and O
// 4. Bind button to one click but keep alternating functionality
// 5. Create player component
// 6. 1st Clicker is x, second is o
// 7. Keep track of player clicks
// 8. Intrepret player wins as score
